Through a case study of narratives of five Sámi immigrant women from the Norwegian side of Sápmi, the study theorizes migration and subsequent Sámi American subjectivity through the emerging concept of diasporic indigeneity. Familial material culture and artistic and textual production are significant sites of memory and meaning-making; however, intangible cultural continuity foundationally expressed in storytelling constitutes diasporic indigeneity in the Sámi American context. The aims of this study are twofold: (1) to reveal and reflect on familial and community-based storytelling as an integral part of oral tradition in diasporic indigeneity in the Sámi American context; (2) to deliberate on Sámi-specific methodologies within the broader framework of Indigenous research methodologies, ethics, and interpretation where oral storytelling intersects with three media: text, photography, and video. The articles illustrate a methodological approach to narrative research by using a Sámi conceptual framework reflective of a process and paradigm aligned with Indigenous storytelling epistemologies. The intersubjective research conversations and collaboratively produced life narratives are interpreted using a temporal-spatial-narrative framework; in this framework, contemporary stories connect the Sámi immigrant women to places in America and to places in Sápmi; further, the stories bind an often silenced or obscured past with a spoken, meaningful present. The dissertation forms part of an ongoing trans-Atlantic collaborative project; the life narratives of the five Sámi immigrant women will be published across media, that is, with and through digital text, photography, and video on a web-based interactive platform. This part of the ongoing project, as well as a general-audience text published in three languages, is intended to answer the call in Indigenous studies research to co-share collaboratively-produced knowledge(s) with various communities in accessible and locally meaningful ways.
